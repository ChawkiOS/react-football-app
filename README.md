Welcome to my first experience with `React`

### React Football App ?

A simple app and that is not a todo app that offers results from more than 100 football leagues. Results, Standings, lineups...

### Data source

[TheSportsDB](https://www.thesportsdb.com/) An open, crowd-sourced database of sports artwork and metadata with a free API.

### Contribute

Sure you can, fork and `let's code`. You can also submit issues and give me feedback so I can improve myself.

### Main goal

Learn to develop with `React` and `Redux`
